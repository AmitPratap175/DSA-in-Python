Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach 
the destination at (N – 1, N – 1). Find all possible paths that the rat can take to 
reach from source to destination. The directions in which the rat can move are 
‘U'(up), ‘D'(down), ‘L’ (left), ‘R’ (right). Value 0 at a cell in the matrix 
represents that it is blocked and rat cannot move to it while value 1 at a cell 
in the matrix represents that rat can be travel through it. Return the list of paths 
in lexicographically increasing order.

Note: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time. If the source cell is 0, 
the rat cannot move to any other cell.
