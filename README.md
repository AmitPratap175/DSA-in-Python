# DSA-in-Python
# ðŸš€ DSA-in-Python  

A collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in Python. This repository serves as a growing library of fundamental and advanced DSA concepts, useful for learning, practice, and interview preparation.  

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  

**Data Structures:**  
- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- Stacks & Queues  
- HashMaps & HashSets  
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Trie)  
- Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix, BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)  
- Heaps & Priority Queues  

**Algorithms:**  
- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)  
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation)  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)  
- String Algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp)    

I update this repo casually with new solutions, optimizations, and explorations. Perfect for practice and learning!
